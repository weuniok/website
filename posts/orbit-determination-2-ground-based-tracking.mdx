# How to Stalk Satellites

In the previous post, we explored the basics of orbits. Now, it's time to roll up the sleeves and dive into the practical aspects: do we actually track these speeding hunks of metal?

## The Observer's Toolkit

Before <i>launching</i> into the mathematics, let's take a moment to understand what tools we use for ground-based spacecraft tracking.

### Optical Tracking: Telescopes and Patience
The simplest way to track spacecraft involves pointing fancy telescopes at the sky and saying "aha!" when you spot something that isn't a star. 

Your equipment ranges from backyard telescopes your spouse thinks were too expensive to professional observatory equipment that definitely was too expensive. These systems measure right ascension and declination (α, δ) - which is a mathy way of describing the direction you were aiming your telescope at. Modern optical tracking equipment can pinpoint objects with arc-second precision.

The U.S. military's Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) system could detect a basketball at geostationary orbit (36,000 km altitude). Unfortunately they would miss a geostationary teapot.

### Radar Tracking: Bouncing Radio Waves Off Things
For objects playing hard-to-get in lower orbits, radar provides both position and speed information.

These systems use large radio dishes or phased array systems that transmit radio pulses and measure their reflections. They capture range, range-rate (speed toward/away from you), and angular position with impressive precision.

### Laser Ranging: For When "Close Enough" Isn't Good Enough
Here you just fire laser beams at your target. The spacecraft is equipped with retroreflectors (fancy mirrors) that reflect the laser beam back to the source. By measuring the time it takes for the laser pulse to travel to the spacecraft and back, we can calculate the distance with incredible precision. This can also work for spacecraft without retroreflectors, but the precision is not as good. The big advantage of laser ranging is that you not only measure the direction, but also the distance to the spacecraft.

## From Angles to Orbits: The Heart of the Problem

When tracking a spacecraft optically, we're essentially collecting a series of "I see it!" moments - directions in the sky at specific times. The fundamental challenge is this: how do we convert these 2D directional measurements into a complete 3D orbit?

### The Observation Vector

From our observation post (whose position we know precisely thanks to GPS, or in a pinch, Google Maps), we record:

- The time of observation (the exact time, not "around 8-ish")
- Right ascension (α) - analogous to longitude on the celestial sphere
- Declination (δ) - analogous to latitude on the celestial sphere

These angular measurements give us a unit vector pointing from the observer to the spacecraft, which we can represent in an Earth-centered reference frame:


But there's a catch - we know the direction, but not the distance! This is the core challenge of angle-only orbit determination.
