## Experience

### Full Stack Developer at QuickerSim — since June 2022
**Distributed Photovoltaic Simulation Platform**
- **Engineered a CAD-like interactive frontend** using **TypeScript**,
  **React**, and **Google Maps API**, allowing users to draw roof geometries,
  position solar panels, and configure simulation parameters.
- **Optimized construction costs** by implementing a MATLAB **linear
  programming** solver that minimizes ballast weight, combining data from heavy
  aerodynamic regression analysis and standard snow load norms.
- **Orchestrated a scalable GCP architecture**, deploying the core **Django**
  application on **App Engine** while offloading resource-intensive simulation
  and reporting microservices to **Cloud Run**.
- **Accelerated report generation by >50%** by refactoring data structures
  (hashmaps) in the **Python** PDF generation service running on **Google Cloud
  Run**.
- **Eliminated silent failure states** during long-running PDF generation by
  replacing HTTP polling with **WebSockets** in **FastAPI**, enabling real-time
  progress bars and status feedback on the frontend.

**National Energy Grid Integration**
- **Designing a high-reliability communication gateway** to interface with the
  National Energy Operator (PSE), utilizing **IBM MQ** for asynchronous
  messaging and a custom **Python** engine for XML serialization.
- **Architected a hybrid frontend** using **Django** templates with embedded
  **React Islands**, strategically deploying complex client-side logic only for
  dynamic, schema-driven forms while maintaining a lightweight server-rendered
  core.

**Engineering Leadership**
- **Led a cross-functional squad** of 3 developers using Agile methodologies,
  delivering complex technical migrations while ensuring high team velocity.
- **Elevated code quality standards** by configuring pre-commit hooks
  (auto-formatting/linting) across all repositories, eliminating style-related
  bottlenecks in code reviews.
- **Accelerated junior developer growth** by enforcing a workflow of atomic Pull
  Requests and conducting educational code reviews focused on architectural best
  practices.
- **Cut deployment time by ~40%** by spearheading the company-wide adoption of
  **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions/Cloud Build) and automated testing suites.

### Co-Founder & Lead Engineer at Neendu (IoT Medtech startup) — July 2023 to October 2025
- **Architected a high-performance mobile application** using **Expo** and
  **React Native**, utilizing **Tamagui** for a unified, optimizing
  compiler-based UI system to ensure consistent performance across devices.
- **Implemented a serverless backend infrastructure** on **Supabase**
  (PostgreSQL), utilizing Row Level Security (RLS) and real-time subscriptions
  to sync vital signs from BLE-connected hardware.
- **Designed a scalable notification architecture** using **Firebase Cloud
  Messaging** (FCM) to deliver critical health alerts to parents instantly.

### Production Engineering Intern at Airbus — from May 2022 to June 2022
- Optimized assembly workflows by analyzing  schematics and
  collaborating with shop-floor technicians to identify and resolve assembly
  bottlenecks.
- Learnt how to talk to people, write dead simple instructions, read schematics.

### **Research Software Development Intern** at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research — from July 2020 to September 2020
- **Developed a high-performance Python pipeline** for processing real-time data
  from cosmic ray detectors and presented statistical findings at an
  international scientific seminar.

## Education

### MScEng Computer Science, Warsaw University of Technology

- Extramural (Weekend) Program; Expected graduation in 2026.

### BEng Aerospace Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology

- **Thesis:** "Use of Error Correction Codes (ECC) to mitigate Single Event
  Upset (SEU) phenomena" – Investigated algorithmic methods for maintaining data
  integrity in high-radiation environments.
- **Project Leadership:** Co-led a 30-person international team for the SAE
  AeroDesign competition; managed a **€40,000 annual budget** and coordinated
  multi-disciplinary engineering workflows.
- **Awards:** Secured 1st Place in Design Presentation and in
  Technical Documentation at SAE AeroDesign East 2022 (USA) against 50+ global
  universities.
- **Technical Research:** Co-authored a paper on the electromagnetic
  interference of 5G C-Band signals with aviation avionics, analyzing signal
  propagation and safety margins.

## Technical Skills & Core Competencies
