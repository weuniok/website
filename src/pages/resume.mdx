## Experience

### Software Engineer at QuickerSim — since June 2022
#### Distributed Photovoltaic Simulation Platform
- **Engineered a CAD-like interactive frontend** TypeScript, React, and Google Maps API to model roof geometry and configure simulations.
- **Reduced construction costs 50%** using a MATLAB linear programming solver that minimized ballast weight through aerodynamic regression.
- **Accelerated key artifact generation by >30%** by refactoring Python PDF generation service.
- **Eliminated silent failure states** by replacing HTTP polling with WebSockets in FastAPI, enabling real-time status feedback.

#### National Energy Grid Integration
- **Developed a high-reliability communication gateway** to interface with the
  National Energy Operator (PSE), utilizing IBM MQ for asynchronous
  messaging and a Python engine for XML serialization.
- **Architected a hybrid frontend** using Django and React Islands, strategically deploying complex client-side logic for dynamic, schema-driven forms

#### Engineering Leadership
- **Led a cross-functional squad** of 3 developers using Agile methodologies,
  delivering complex technical migrations while ensuring high team velocity.
- **Elevated code quality standards** by configuring pre-commit hooks, eliminating style-related
  bottlenecks in code reviews.
- **Cut deployment time by ~40%** by spearheading CI/CD adoption

### Co-Founder & Engineer at Neendu (IoT Medtech startup) - from July 2023 to October 2025 [evenings and weekends]
- **Architected a high-performance mobile application** using Expo and
  React Native, utilizing Tamagui for a unified, optimizing
  compiler-based UI system to ensure consistent performance across devices.
- **Implemented serverless backend** on Supabase (PostgreSQL), utilizing Row Level Security for real-time health data sync from BLE hardware.

### **Research Software Development Intern** at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research — from July 2020 to September 2020
- **Engineered a Python telemetry interface** connecting dual cosmic ray detectors via Serial I/O, implementing real-time data visualization and statistical logging.
